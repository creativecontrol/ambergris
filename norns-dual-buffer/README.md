# Norns Dual Buffer 
This is a basic example showing the logic of using both 5 minute softcut buffers to play longer files using softcut to allow for more control over the playback than is available with the Norns Tape functionality. Some options available using this technique.

* non-looping playback
* playback speed control
* panning control
* sending messages at certain points of playback for control or sync of external systems
