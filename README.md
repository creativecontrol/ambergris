# Ambergris

Ambergris is a set of musical compositions built around modified recordings of whalesongs orginally created by the [Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute Marine Accelerated Research System (MARS)](https://www.mbari.org/technology/monterey-accelerated-research-system-mars/)

The performance of these compositions rely on the [Norns](https://monome.org/docs/norns/) sound computer for audio file playback and real-time sound-on-sound audio looping.

I am storing these in a repository for tracking changes and improvements to the system for my own use. I also believe that there is some merit to the techniques used in these scripts for others who want to use the norns for live performance; more as techniques to facilitate a performance rather than a compositional structure or performance instrument as many of the other norns scripts present.
